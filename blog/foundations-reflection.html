            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>I shouldn't let my ego make me feel I should learn everything instantly.</li>  
                <li>I shouldn't let my ego tell it's not okay to make mistakes.</li>  
                <li>I shouldn't let my ego tell me I'm useless when it takes time to solve a problem.</li>  
            </ol>

            What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
        </p>
        <p>
            Vales, empathy and self awarness teach you to be a better coder. They allow you to write code that
            works well for and with others, and allow you to work well for and with others.

            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
            I consider myself to be fairly emmotinally intelligent, however the core learning has let me see
            areas in which I can improve.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
            Talking about myself.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </p>
        <p>
            These core skills make use highly employable, and help us stand out amongst other developers. 
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
            Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not at all, it felt like a valuable use of my time.
