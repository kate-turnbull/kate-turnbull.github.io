        <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
        </h3>
<p>During my time in one of my marketing work environments there was an instance where we were having our weekly team stand up. The meeting had gone off topic, a few of the team members had decided it was appropriate to discuss a work mate that wasn’t in the room. None of it was work based chat, it was all mean and totally unnecessary. It went completely against my belief that you should treat everyone with respect. No one was really calling them out on it so I did, I tried to approach it with the professional angle of lets spend this time focused on the sprint not talking about people that aren’t present. Needless to say I was not very popular with these teammates after that, but I never had been in the first place.

<h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
</h3>
<p>I’m am ENFP-T, individuals like me are outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. They long for meaningful, emotional connections with other people. My five biggest strengths are optimism, empathiser, peacekeeper, thinker and self believer. My limitations are a reflection of this, I find it hard to complete tasks if I don’t find them engaging, I am a bigger picture person which means I need this in order to focus on the small stuff that makes up a task and because I’m a peacekeeper I can find it hard to voice my opinion if I feel uncomfortable or don’t think it will be well received. Which makes this the hardest task of the sprint for me! I’d rather talk about anything to people other than myself! In terms of my career development up until this point I’ve worked in environments that are not conducive to my strengths, however in terms of learning these strengths all work well in the flipped environment, and so far I’ve felt like I’m growing as a result. 
</p>
<h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
</h3>
<p>As mentioned I think my strengths work well in my learning environment. The biggest learning obstacle will be a result of my need to have the bigger picture to focus on the small stuff that makes up a task, as I’ll need to pivote to focus on each step of the task to be able to understand the bigger picture. I think this will be good for me though.

<h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
</h3>
<p>At my previous job there was one colleague that very early on in my time with the company was convinced I was useless at my job (in their defence I hate marketing! So they were probably right). I often had to work with them on projects, and found that as a result of this belief of theirs it was very difficult to get anything done, and that often the whole project experience was very negative. After discussing this with a more senior member of the team I decided the best cause of action was to try to discuss this with the colleague in question, to see if we could come to an understanding and make the work environment more positive for the both of us. Bear in mind I was petrified, it was not an easy step for me to take. It turned out to be the best thing though! We had a really open, caring discussion that resulted in a much healthier work environment for the both of us. To the point where she became one of the colleagues I was most comfortable working with. I’ve worked with difficult people before, however this was the first time I have tried this strategy. I think if I was to be confronted with the same situation again I would try to use the same strategy, with one caveat. It’s not always going to work out this well with difficult colleagues, however even if it doesn’t work out as well as it did in the above instance at the very least they’ll realise I’m not a pushover and will ease off on their behaviour slightly.
