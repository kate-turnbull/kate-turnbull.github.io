        <p class="title">What is Neuroplasticity?
        </p>
<p class="title">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
</p>
<p>Simply knowing and understanding neuroplasticity helps you to develop the neural pathways within your 
    brain, and understand that youâ€™re capable of learning anything you put your mind to.  
</p>
<p class="title">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
</p>
<p>Remind myself that I, like everyone else, have the ability to shape my brain and use this to my advantage when learning new things. 
    Remind myself of this especially when I become frustrated during my JavaScript learning journey. 
</p>
<p class="title">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
</p>
<p>By engaging in activities that are new, engaging and challenging for you. Such as learning to code, exercising and creating art.
</p>
<p class="title">Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
</p>
<p>I found the below video particularly engaging. Much of the Ted Talk focuses on a woman who unkowingly was born with a large chunk of her brain 
    missing. Her brain was so powerful she was able to function in society without it thanks to neuroplasticity.
