    Discuss a time you got blocked on a simple problem
</p>
<p>
    While working on the first challenge within the Variables and Objects Kata I got stuck on the second question. I had just been way over thinking the whole exercise.
    Instead of approaching it step by step I was trying to solve the end problem. I took a step back, and cut it up into little questions, and answered
    each little question first. I felt much less overwhelmed when cutting it into smaller sections. I learned to approach each error a step at a time, and not let 
    myself get overwhelemed.

    Discuss a time you solved a problem in an elegent way
</p>
<p>
    While working on the jumble your words problem in JS-Olympics I had to complete 3 steps to solve the problem, I found a way to solve it by cleanly linking all 
    3 solutions together. Again I used my method of seperating out the task into smaller steps, and then finessing the code for them to all be appleid within the one function.
    I felt really happy, that I had figured out how to do soemthing which seemed complex to me. I learned how to attempt to make my code clean.

<p class="title">
    How confident do I feel using:
</p>
<p>
    Pseudocode : I feel comfortable writing it for myself, but feel I need to imrpvoe it further so others can understand it clearly.
</p>
<p>
    Trying soemthing: I feel comfortable trying new things.
</p>
<p>
    Rubber ducky method: I need to practice this further, I feel I still do it as if I'm just talking to myself. 
</p>
<p>
    Reading error messages: I feel confident reading them, I need to work further on figuring out how to fix the isue that is causing the error messages.
</p>
<p>
    Console logging: I feel comfortable doing this, also love how it helps you see if you're heading in the right direction or not.
</p>
<p>
    Googling: This is my current go to method, I feel confident doing it however again I want to practice it further.
</p>
<p>
    Asking peers for help: This is usually my last resort, not beacuse I don't think that they'll help. I just want to try as hard as possible to 
    solve it myself first.
</p>
<p>
    Asking coaches for help: I like this method when I'm curious about how to study some things further outside of the curriculum. 
</p>
<p>
    Improving your process with reflection: I like this method, I swear I've been dreaming about better solutions
