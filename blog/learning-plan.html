            My bootcamp Learning Plan
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </p>
        <p>
            I would like to use the skills I learn during bootcamp to secure a full time job as a junior developer. 
            The goal is to begin my new career in a location I feel more connected to, as my partner and I have outgrown Auckland. 
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </p>
        <p>
            They’ve remained the same. For the most part they will help me during bootcamp, 
            I think my need for the bigger picture will be something I need to work on to be able to use that to my advantage.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </p>
        <p>
            Honestly I think the biggest challenge will be keeping focused all day long, I tend to take biggish breaks throughout 
            the day and I won’t be able to do that during bootcamp. 
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </p>
        <p>
            I can struggle with voicing my opinion when it comes to ideas for projects or ways of doing things, this is a 
            human skill I’ve been working hard on outside of the course, and something I would like to work on inside the course too. 
            In a broader sense this also means I would like to work on my team working skills, while I’m a great supportive team member 
            I’d really like to develop the skill of contributing my ideas to the team.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
        </p>
        <p>
            I expect them to be open and honest, and willing to help when I come to them for advice or with questions. 
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
        </p>
        <p>
            I will speak up during class, when the time is right, if I need assistance. 
            I’ll also work after class and ask any questions I have before the team has to go home. 

            I will manage my emotions and responses to challenges to ensure I’m a positive presence to work with. 
            I’ll manage my workload by building my life around bootcamp for the full 9 weeks.

            My Foundations Learning Plan
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What is my long term goal/and or career path?
        </p>
        <p>
            My long term goal is to become a full-time developer. To grow my skills to become a skilled senior developer, 
            and have the freedom to work remotely when it suits me. 
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning:
        </p>
        <p>
            five biggest strengths are optimism, empathiser, peacekeeper, thinker and self believer. 
            My limitations are a reflection of this, I find it hard to complete tasks if I don’t find them engaging, 
            I am a bigger picture person which means I need this in order to focus on the small stuff that makes up a task and 
            because I’m a peacekeeper I can find it hard to voice my opinion if I feel uncomfortable or don’t think it will be well received.
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </p>
        <p>
            I really want to develop my problem solving skills/thinking like a developer. 
            I think naturally that will occur as I practice coding, but I want to keep it in front of my mind for myself as well. 

            As mentioned above I can struggle with voicing my opinion when it comes to ideas for projects or ways of doing things, 
            this is a human skill I’ve been working hard on outside of the course, and something I would like to work on inside the course too.

            In a broader sense this also means I would like to work on my team working skills, while I’m a great supportive team member 
            I’d really like to develop the skill of contributing my ideas to the team.

            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </p>
        <p>With myself: 

            I will hold myself accountable when working on and completing tasks, I’ll still stick to my 30min - 1hour rule. 
            30 minutes if I’m feeling stuck, to an hour if I’m feeling in a state of flow. Followed by a quick break. 
            I’ll spend every work day as well as time on both weekend days completing tasks and practicing further, to ensure I don’t miss any days. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With facilitators/learners/industry/community representatives:

            I’ll be respectful and open minded when working with anyone else other than myself. I’ll reach out when coursemates 
            ask questions and be open to explaining anything I’ve worked on with anyone and always look to learn further from those around me. 
        </p>

            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        </p>
        <p>
            Take a big breath and if I’ve been digging and not getting anywhere take a step away from the computer. Pat my dog and give myself 
            a break from the problem. Reach out for help in slack. If I'm still finding it hard to shake my frustration I’ll go for a walk. 
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ll reach out on slack in the #foundations channel whenever I feel I need help. 
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
        </p>
        <p>
            As this is a flipped learning environment I expect them to be open to me coming to them with questions, 
            I don’t expect them to reply immediately just when they have time to. 
        </p>
        <p class="title">
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only commitments I have are fitting in exercise and taking my dog for walks, which I happily plan around my course work.
