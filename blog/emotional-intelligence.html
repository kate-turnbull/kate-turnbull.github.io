        <p class="title">What is Emotional Intelligence? 
        </p>
<p>The ability to be aware of your emotions, and then control and express them. As well as notice and comprehend other people’s emotions, and interact with them in a healthy way.  
</p>
<p class="title">How is it different from IQ?
</p>
<p>While IQ measures your ability to use logic to understand and explain complex problems and ideas, EQ measures your ability to do the same with your emotions and the emotions of everyone around you. 
</p>
<p class="title">Why is it important?
</p>
<p>While your IQ is important, it’s your EQ that will help you excel in your career. High EQ allows you to work well as part of a team, to be an understanding leader and to play an important role within whatever company you wish to work for. (Or as a leader of your own company if that’s the route you want to take too).
