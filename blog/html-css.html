    <h4 class="questions">What's a Class, and what's an ID?</h4>
    <p>These are both used within CSS to style elements of your html. An easy way to destinguish them is to think of Class as your surname, and IDs as your first name.

    </p>
    <p>Classe's can be applied to more than one element. For example you could have a class titled questions that can be applied to all of the header elements within your page. Using this class you could then edit the css for all of them at once. When writing CSS place a full stop before a class. You can see the class and CSS I've applied to my titles.

    </p>

    <img id="class-example" src="../Images/Class-Example.png" alt="Class Example"/> 
    <p id="individual">ID's are individual, and can only be applied to one elements. For example, if you had one titled question that you wanted to stand out from the rest you would give it an id of say stand-out-title, and use this to edit the css. Below you can see the ID and CSS I've applied to these sentences.

  <h4 class="questions">The Golden Rule of Classes Vs. IDs</h4>
  <p>Always remember you can use the same class across multipule elements, but can only ever use the same ID once. It's important to remember IDs will always overide class styling. When it comes to making your life simple use Class whenever you want to aply the same styling to multipule elements, and ID when you want to style an indiviudal element differently. it's  also worth remembering that an element can be assigned multipule classes! But can only ever be assigned one ID.

  <h4 class="questions">Naming Conventions</h4>
  <p>Finally, make sure when creating names for Classes and IDs that they're easy to remember and anyone jumping into your code for the first time could comprehend. There's no point quickly typing out a class name only to be confused by it later down the line.
